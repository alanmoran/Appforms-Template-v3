FedHenry Drag & Drop Apps Template App v3
-------------------------------
This Template App is intended to work with the Drag & Drop Apps feature in the Red Hat Mobile Application Platform.

This Template App builds the [appforms-project-client](https://github.com/feedhenry/appforms-project-client) Template App.

It is based on Backbone and uses the $fh.forms.bacbone SDK to render forms into the app.

To build:

    grunt

Produces a *dist* folder and *dist-dev* folder.

 - The *dist* folder contains the minified version of the template app.
 - The *dist-dev* folder contains the non-minified version of the template app. This is useful for debugging.
